      <h3> About Us</h3>
<p>The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the UNFCCC will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.  
COP 27 was originally expected to take place from 8-20 November 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, COP 26 was rescheduled from 
November 2020 to November 2021. As a result, COP 27 will take place from 7-18 November 2022. 
We will update this page when the agenda for COP 27 is announced.
